# Tic Tac Toe

An implementation of a tic-tac-toe game in Java. The singleplayer version of the game uses the minimax algorithm, so you will never be able to beath the computer in singleplayer mode. You can also play against a friend in multiplayer mode. For the best experience export the project as a runnable JAR, and run the JAR from the terminal of a unix machine.
'''java -JAR tictactoe.JAR'''
